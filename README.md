# Apps That Are Cool

A curated list of apps Iâ€™ve found useful, especially for developers, tinkerers, and anyone who likes having awesome tools on their device.

Each app listed here is either powerful, privacy-respecting, open-source, or just plain cool. Whether you're into modding, coding, or just want better alternatives to mainstream apps, there's something here for you.

Check out the full list and download links in the [Releases section](https://github.com/curbfuckinrules/Apps-That-Are-Cool/releases).
